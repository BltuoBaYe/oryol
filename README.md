# _Oryol_
 
Experimental C++11 multi-platform 3D engine.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/floooh/oryol.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/floooh/oryol)

## _Public Service Announcements_

- **13-Jun-2015**: compiling the samples for PNaCl with the latest pepper_canary is currently broken because of this issue: https://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=4200

- **22-May-2015**: master branch might be broken a bit in the next couple days, don't panic, if I get back to a somewhat stable state I'll move the remaining D3D11 work into a branch (•_•) / ( •_•)>⌐■-■ / (⌐■_■)

- **17-Jan-2015**: I have switched the Oryol master branch over to use 
[fips](http://floooh.github.com/fips) as 
build system, 'fips' is the former Oryol build system moved into its
own project, plus some goodies. Check the updated [BUILD.md](doc/BUILD.md) for
details, the TL;DR is to run **./fips** instead of **./oryol**. Some subcommand
names have changed, check **./fips help** for that!
