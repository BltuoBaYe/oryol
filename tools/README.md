This directory contains a bunch of precompiled 3rd-party tools. It is not a replacement for a proper tools pipeline.

### NVIDIA Texture Tools

The tools **nvcompress**, **nvassemble**, **nvddsinfo** have been compiled from the
repository at:

https://github.com/floooh/nvidia-texture-tools

which is a fork of

https://github.com/casseveritt/nvidia-texture-tools

The nvcompress tool has been enhanced slightly to support more uncompressed RGBA formats in WebGL/OpenGLES component order.

### GLSL Reference Compiler

The **glslangValidator** has been compiled unchanged from the SVN repo at:

https://cvs.khronos.org/svn/repos/ogl/trunk/ecosystem/public/sdk/tools/glslang

See [GLSLReferenceCompiler.txt](GLSLReferenceCompiler.txt) for details.
